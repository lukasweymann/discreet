# discreet
Discreet is an app project we build in collaboration with developer Donald Roshi. Discreet aims to be a login page which gives you the option of using facial recognition as your entry pass without the need of a password. The project will be built in Javascript with NodeJS in the backend and an interface in pure HTML and CSS.
